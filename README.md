#NaTour21
University Project for Software Engineering

NaTour21 is a social network designed for hiking enthusiasts and outdoor lovers. The platform allows users to create personal profiles, create hiking routes, reviews of their adventures, and connect with other hikers to exchange tips, organize outings, and discover new trails.

The project includes a backend that handles user authentication, data management for profiles, routes, comments, and social interactions.
Alongside the backend, NaTour21 features a native Android mobile app providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for exploring content, posting updates, and interacting with the hiking community on the go.
